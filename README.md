# STOM-Higgs-Boson-Mass-Data-Analysis
- A 1st year statistics of measurements group project for the undergraduate physics course at Imperial College London.
- Utilised the Monte Carlo method to conduct data simulation, sampling, and hypotheses testing to determine the existence of the Higgs Boson particle and calculate its rest mass within 5% significance level. 
- Investigated the properties of the Gaussian peaks (corresponding to the Higgs' signature back-to-back photon decays) superposed on background exponential decays. 

Result:
- Simulated Higgs Boson rest mass = 125.1 +/- 1.2 GeV c^-2
- Reference Higgs Boson rest mass = 125.35 +/- 0.15 GeV c^-2
